# Co-design Student Chatbot

Local critical-thinking coach for university students. The app is a **Streamlit**
UI plus a **FastAPI** coaching API. Student data stays on your machine (SQLite +
files under `data/`). There is no cloud auth in this prototype.

Use **one command** to start everything. That command starts both services with
`USE_LOCAL_API=true`, which is required for:

- Thinking Path / progress-bar stage advancement
- Structured coach assessments and Review personalization
- Selected **image** sources being sent to the coach

Starting Streamlit alone (without the API) leaves the Learning Path stuck and
skips image grounding on the coaching path.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+** (3.12 recommended)
- macOS or Linux shell (`zsh` / `bash`)
- Optional later: [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) or an OpenAI API key

---

## First-time setup

From the project root (`Co-design Chatbot`):

### 1. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
cd "/path/to/Co-design Chatbot"
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "\path\to\Co-design Chatbot"
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Confirm the venv is active (`which python` / `where python` should point inside
`.venv`).

### 2. Install dependencies

Prefer `pip` from the active venv (same as `pip3` inside `.venv`):

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Equivalent if the venv is already active:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create a local env file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The example defaults are safe for local development:

- `MODEL_PROVIDER=mock` — no API key required
- `USE_LOCAL_API=true` — coaching API enabled (also forced by `scripts/start.sh`)
- `AUTO_ADVANCE_STAGES=false` — coach recommends a stage; press **Next** and confirm

Do **not** commit `.env` (it may contain secrets later).

### 4. Start the whole program (one command)

```bash
sh scripts/start.sh
```

These aliases do the **same** thing:

```bash
sh scripts/run.sh
sh scripts/dev.sh
sh scripts/run_local_demo.sh
```

Then open:

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Streamlit UI | [http://127.0.0.1:8501](http://127.0.0.1:8501) |
| API health | [http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/health](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/health) |

Stop with `Ctrl+C` in the terminal that ran the script (it stops both API and UI).

---

## Everyday restart

If the venv already exists and dependencies are installed:

```bash
cd "/path/to/Co-design Chatbot"
source .venv/bin/activate
sh scripts/start.sh
```

You can also run without activating first; `scripts/start.sh` prefers
`.venv/bin/python` when that interpreter exists.

---

## What you get in mock mode

With `MODEL_PROVIDER=mock` (default in `.env.example`):

1. First chat turn at a stage gets guidance (stage stays).
2. Second turn at that stage advances the Thinking Path (progress bar updates).
3. Upload/select sources (including images); the API coach path receives selected
   image inputs for grounding.

No OpenAI key is required.

---

## Optional: live providers

### Ollama (local model)

```bash
ollama pull gpt-oss:20b
```

In `.env`:

```bash
MODEL_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434
OLLAMA_CHAT_MODEL=gpt-oss:20b
```

Then:

```bash
sh scripts/start.sh
```

### OpenAI (paid — only with explicit approval / budget)

In `.env`:

```bash
MODEL_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL=gpt-5.6-luna
DEFAULT_REASONING_EFFORT=low
MOCK_OPENAI=false
```

Paid calls are **not** part of the default local workflow. Keep mock or Ollama
for routine development.

### Thinking Path Next confirmation

Default: `AUTO_ADVANCE_STAGES=false`. After the coach recommends the next stage:

1. Press **Next** on Thinking Path.
2. Read the warning that confirming early can make the process less critical.
3. Press **Next** again in the dialog to confirm (or Cancel).

Quick guidance is a lighter advance bar; Complex is stricter. To restore silent
auto-advance:

```bash
AUTO_ADVANCE_STAGES=true
```

## Course materials (`lecture_notes/`)

Put instructor PDFs and related files under:

- `lecture_notes/lectureNotes/`
- `lecture_notes/readings/`

They sync into each notebook as locked **Lecture Notes** / **Readings** groups.
`lecture_notes/README.txt` is instructional only and is not imported. Git ignores
lecture contents; originals are never moved.

Trusted course files may be up to **50 MB**; student uploads remain **25 MB**
(up to 10 files per add).

---

## Architecture (local)

```text
scripts/start.sh
  ├── FastAPI  backend.api:app     :8000   (coach turns, transitions)
  └── Streamlit streamlit_app.py   :8501   (ui/ panels)

ui/  → presentation only
backend/ → domain, workflow, providers, SQLite, sources
```

Prefer the API coaching path for all new behaviour. The legacy
`StudentChatEngine` path exists only as a fallback when `USE_LOCAL_API` is off;
do not use that for normal local development.

---

## Tests

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest -q
PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/private/tmp/co-design-pycache \
  python -m compileall -q backend ui streamlit_app.py
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Progress bar never leaves Focus | UI started without API | Use `sh scripts/start.sh` only |
| Coach error about local API | API not up / wrong URL | Check `:8000/api/v1/health`; keep `CO_DESIGN_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000` |
| Provider / OpenAI errors on first run | `.env` set to `openai` without a key | Set `MODEL_PROVIDER=mock` |
| Port already in use | Another process on 8000 or 8501 | Stop the other process, then restart `start.sh` |
| Imports missing | Wrong Python / no venv packages | `source .venv/bin/activate` then `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` |
